            <p class="lead">This article will help you avoid some common errors that most of us make architecting react applications, and will give you the right way to structure your directories.</p>
			
            <p>Before starting, it’s necessary to underline a point: there is no perfect solution that fits any possible case. This is particularly important to understand because a lot of developers are always looking for the one and only one solution to all their problems, I’m sorry to say that if you are looking for this, this could not be the article for you.</p>

			<p>If you have arrived here, it means that you are interested in the topic, so, it’s finally time to start! All the content I will mention will be put into an <code>src</code> directory, and every mention of new folders will be relative to this constraint, keep it in mind.</p>

			<h3>Our another and princesses by the text</h3>
