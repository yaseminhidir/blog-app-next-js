            <p>When developing Node.js applications, we often face some problems such as code duplication, unorganized codebase, and tight coupling. In the next section we use a simple example of a Node.js application that retrieves data from a database and returns it as a JSON response to solve these problems. Clean Architecture provides solutions to these problems by emphasizing on the following principles:</p>
            
            <p>Separation of Concerns (SoC)</p>
            <p>A fundamental principle of software engineering that emphasizes the importance of dividing a system into distinct modules or components, each with a specific and independent responsibility. In Node.js, SoC is often implemented using a modular architecture, where each module is responsible for a single task or functionality.</p>
            <p>In Clean Architecture, dependencies are inverted, which means the higher-level modules should depend on lower-level modules. This ensures that the business logic is not coupled with the infrastructure details.</p>
