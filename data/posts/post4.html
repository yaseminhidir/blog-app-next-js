            <p class="lead">Motion design is becoming an integral part of interface design. The continual evolution of animation and video compression, paired with the increasing capacities of the internet, browsers and devices, has allowed more <strong>complex and nuanced motion in interfaces without sacrificing speed or efficiency</strong>.</p>
            <p>One subset of motion design that deserves close attention is scrollytelling or immersive scrolling. In a similar fashion to other animation and micro-interactions, scrollytelling is becoming increasingly prominent in <strong>enriching the interaction between users and products</strong>.</p>
            <p>Very little is novel about the direction in which minimalism is going next — at least at first glance. All the essential elements of minimalism are there: <strong>focus on</strong> <strong>functional objects without un-functional decor,</strong> <strong>unobstructed negative space, flat elements and patterns, easy navigation and limited color palettes</strong>. What makes the upcoming minimalism trend different is more nuanced and evolved take on the existing concept.</p>

            <p>What is becoming known as <strong>‘dopamine dressing</strong>’ predominantly in fashion, builds off of the retro comeback of recent years and centers around the symbolic qualities of bold and happy hues. Interfaces are not immune to this trend, as it continues to evolve and redefine the ground rules for personal and brand expression. <strong>Color blocking, mild textures and therapeutic hues</strong> combined with <strong>retro elements and superimposed on brutalist and even anti-design </strong>layouts will make bold statements to users from <strong>the 70s all the way to gen Z.</strong></p>
