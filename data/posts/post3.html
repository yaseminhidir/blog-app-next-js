                of a front-end developer is not going away.</p>

            <p> Microservices have been overtaking the finance industry since their high deployment in the mid-2010s.

            <p>Adopting a microservices architecture over a monolith is becoming the trend for web development, as shown
                by this IBM report.</p>

            <p>One of the important conclusions from this is that microservices users aim to grow their trust in this
                technology as the years go by, with 77% of users thinking that microservices are a “time-tested

            </p>

            <p>The front end of this method is composed of several microservices that may be deployed freely by the team
                in charge of that service.</p>
