            <p class="lead">Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the real DOM. When we create a rendered component, React
                creates a <strong>virtual DOM</strong> for its element tree in the component.</p>
            <p>
                Then, whenever the state of the component changes, React recreates the virtual DOM tree and compares the
                result with the previous render. It then only updates the changed element in the actual DOM. This
                process is called diffing. </p>

            <p>React uses the concept of a virtual DOM to minimize the performance cost of re-rendering a webpage
                because the actual DOM is expensive to manipulate. </p>

            <p>This feature is great because it speeds up the UI render time. However, it can also slow down a complex
                app if itâ€™s not managed well. </p>

            <p>What we can deduce here is that a state change in a React component causes a re-render. Likewise, when
                the state passes down to a child component as a prop, it re-renders the child and so on. </p>
